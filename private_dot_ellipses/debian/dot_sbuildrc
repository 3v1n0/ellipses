## DPKG-BUILDPACKAGE OPTIONS

# Name to use as override in .changes files for the Maintainer: field
# Defaults to the DEBEMAIL environment variable, if set, or else the
# Maintainer: field will not be overridden unless set here.

# Name to use as override in .changes file for the Changed-By: field.

# Key ID to use in .changes for the current upload.
# It overrides both $maintainer_name and $uploader_name

# PGP-related option to pass to dpkg-buildpackage. Usually neither .dsc
# nor .changes files shall be signed automatically.

# By default, the -s option only includes the .orig.tar.gz when needed
# (i.e. when the Debian revision is 0 or 1).  By setting this option
# to 1, the .orig.tar.gz will always be included when -s is used.

# This command is run with the dpkg-buildpackage command line passed to it
# (in the chroot, if doing a chrooted build).  It is used by the sparc buildd
# (which is sparc64) to call the wrapper script that sets the environment to
# sparc (32-bit).  It could be used for other build environment setup scripts

## SBUILD BEHAVIOUR
##

# "successful", and "always"

# build failures) and "buildd" (exit status does not report build
# failures) for use in a buildd setup.

## TIMEOUTS
##

## FILE AND DIRECTORY LOCATIONS

# defaults to the current working directory.  $HOME/build is another
# common configuration.
