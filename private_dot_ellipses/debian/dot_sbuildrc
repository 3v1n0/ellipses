## DPKG-BUILDPACKAGE OPTIONS

# Name to use as override in .changes files for the Maintainer: field
# Defaults to the DEBEMAIL environment variable, if set, or else the
# Maintainer: field will not be overridden unless set here.
$maintainer_name='Marco Trevisan (Treviño) <marco@ubuntu.com>';

# Name to use as override in .changes file for the Changed-By: field.

# Key ID to use in .changes for the current upload.
# It overrides both $maintainer_name and $uploader_name
$key_id='45B1103FB93ACBD90296DBCAE83D089481836EBF';

# PGP-related option to pass to dpkg-buildpackage. Usually neither .dsc
# nor .changes files shall be signed automatically.

$resolve_alternatives = 1;

# By default, the -s option only includes the .orig.tar.gz when needed
# (i.e. when the Debian revision is 0 or 1).  By setting this option
# to 1, the .orig.tar.gz will always be included when -s is used.
# This is equivalent to --force-orig-source.

# PATH to set when running dpkg-buildpackage.

# This command is run with the dpkg-buildpackage command line passed to it
# (in the chroot, if doing a chrooted build).  It is used by the sparc buildd
# (which is sparc64) to call the wrapper script that sets the environment to
# sparc (32-bit).  It could be used for other build environment setup scripts

## SBUILD BEHAVIOUR
##

# Default distribution

# When to purge the build directory afterwards; possible values are "never",
# "successful", and "always"
#$purge_build_directory="successful";

# build failures) and "buildd" (exit status does not report build
# failures) for use in a buildd setup.
#$sbuild_mode = "user";


##
## TIMEOUTS
##

# Time to wait for a source dependency lock.  The default is 1 minute.

# Time (in minutes) of inactivity after which a build is terminated. Activity
# is measured by output to the log file.

# a file) and need a different timeout. Below are some examples.

## FILE AND DIRECTORY LOCATIONS
##

# This option is deprecated.  Directory for chroot symlinks and sbuild
# logs.  Defaults to the current directory if unspecified.  It is used
# as the location of chroot symlinks (obsolete) and for current build
# log symlinks and some build logs.  There is no default; if unset, it
# defaults to the current working directory.  $HOME/build is another
# common configuration.
